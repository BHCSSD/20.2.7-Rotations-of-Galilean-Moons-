# 20.2.7-Rotations-of-Galilean-Moons

Watch a YouTube video on [rotations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9sgjuh-CBM&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain) and then use the information from the video to recreate the rotations of Jupiter's Galilean moons. We will follow the data provided in the Wikipedia article about [Galilean Moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_moons) for accuracy.


## todo:
1. Draw Jupiter as an ellipse, and have it rotate counterclockwise. (Don't worry about the speed of rotation compared to Io etc.)
2. Draw Io, this will be your reference rotation for the other moons
3. Add the other 2 moons
4. Final: add in an if statement that colours the moons when they align
